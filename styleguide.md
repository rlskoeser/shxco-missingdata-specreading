# Style guide

This document describes agreed-upon conventions for structuring code in this repository,
for consistency.  Conventions should be added as we determine them.

## file naming
- folders should use lower case and underscores rather than dashes, i.e.
  `missing_data` rather than `missing-data`
- code notebooks should be named with PascalCase, e.g. `MissingMembers.ipynb`

## notebooks
- use Markdown headers where possible to structure the code
- limit any display of data to a few rows so that the notebooks are more readable
