# Appendix: Speculative Reading

This folder includes additional, exploratory work that is related to the member analysis and recommendations in the "Speculative Reading" section of the "Missing Data, Speculative Reading" article but that was cut from the article.

## Contents

- [identify_partial_borrowers.py](identify_partial_borrowers.py) — script to identify "partial borrowers" (members with incomplete borrowing histories), and the subscription periods with no documented borrowing; the data files generated by this script are in the associated [data directory](data)
- [Sco_partialborrowers_info.ipynb](Sco_partialborrowers_info.ipynb) — analyze the known borrowing behavior of partial borrowers (Hemingway and a few others), and generate raincloud plots
